    "- start station name\n",
    "- end station name\n",
    "- station ID\n",
    "- station Lat/Long\n",

    "- Year of Birth\n",
    "- Removed test trips by staff and trips below 60 s (false starts or users trying to redock bike for security)\n",
    "- Mileage estimates are calculated using an assumed speed of 7.456 miles per hour, up to hours. Trips over two hours max out at 14.9 miles\n",

    "- Who rides Citi Bike? What are the demographics like? -- could maybe tie with the census\n",
    "- What are Citi Bike's underserved areas? In terms of the most popular routes taken and decreasing bike congestion, which would we be the best location for a new Citi Bike location? (I could break up the map into cells and predict traffic for each cell to see which areas seem underserved)\n",
    "    - Everyone uses Google maps bike routes is the assumption\n",
    "- What are the most popular times in which Citi Bike is used?\n",
    "- What are the most popular stations and why?\n",
    "- Predict the trip duration based off of gender and year of birth\n",
    "- What is the impact of weather on ridership?\n",
    "- NYC Trips Between Manhattan and other boroughs and vise versa\n",
    "- Using google maps bike estimates - linear regression model of difference in actual-estimate to see coefficients of gender, age, and distance of trip\n",
    "- How to best manage the demand of bikes at each station -- \"magical transport\" (manual moving of bikes - which bikes started at a different station than the drop off)\n",
    "- Modeling ridership at the individual station level?\n",
    "- Comparing Citi Bike data with w/ taxi and Uber data: neighborhoods w/ highest and lowest ratios of Citi Bike rides compared to taxi trips? Commutes where itâ€™s faster to take a Citi Bike than a taxi during rush hour traffic?\n",
