    "My dataset is very large (30 million+ rows, one for each Citi Bike trip taken) and broken up into 40+ separate files (each file has data over a specific month and year). Unfortunately, Citi Bike has not uploaded data for 2017, so the data only includes rides taken through December 31st, 2016. For question 1, I will use the data from December of 2016 to approximate the current number of stations and their locations. \n",

    "Because the dataset is so large, I plan on creating new CSV files for questions 2-5, one for each question, with the answers to those questions. For example, for question 2, I will loop through the 40+ separate files and send the 10 most popular stations with their name, station id, longitude, and latitude for a given month and year to one CSV. I will also include one column in the CSV for the month and year over which the stations were popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "For question 6, I will first need to figure out how I want to measure \"impact\" of ridership. My first inclination is to measure the impact by a percentage drop in the number of rides, but I will need to figure out what threshold I want to use. Additionally, I will need to add a column to each of the 40+ CSV files with the average weather for each date included in the files. Next, I will compare the average "
