This repository contains files and exercises for Springboard's Data Science Intensive Workshop. The workshop is divided into 5 parts:
      
  1. Data Wranging: data cleaning with pandas, learning to work with different types of files, data wrangling with JSON and XML files,          and working with data in databases with SQL
